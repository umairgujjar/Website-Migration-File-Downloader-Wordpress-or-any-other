# PHP File Downloader Tool for Website Migrations

This PHP tool is designed to make downloading files from any URL simple and efficient. Itâ€™s especially useful for website migrations, WordPress site transfers, or any task involving moving large amounts of data between servers. The script uses **cURL** for optimized file downloads and provides a simple user interface to initiate the process.

## Features
- **Simple Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web form to input the file URL and start the download.
- **cURL Efficient Download**: Uses cURL for efficient, memory-friendly downloading of large files.
- **Error and Success Feedback**: Provides feedback about download status (success or error messages).
- **Responsive Design**: Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and mobile-friendly user experience.
- **Ideal for Migration**: Perfect for migrating WordPress sites or transferring data across servers.

## Use Cases
- Migrating **WordPress sites** between hosting servers.
- Moving large data backups from one server to another.
- Downloading assets and files from remote servers to local systems during migrations.
- General-purpose file downloading for developers and system administrators.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Download the script**: Clone or download the repository files to your local server.
2. **Modify the destination folder**: Open the `import.php` file and set the `$destination_folder` variable to the directory where you want to save the downloaded files.
   - Example: `'/path/to/your/backup/folder/'`
3. **Permissions**: Ensure the destination folder is writable by the web server to avoid permission errors.
4. **Upload to Server**: Upload the PHP file to your web server where you want the downloads to occur.
5. **Test the Tool**: Access the page via your browser, input a URL of the file you want to download, and hit 'Download' to transfer the file.

## Example
- Source URL: `https://example.com/file.zip`
- Destination folder: `/path/to/your/destination/folder/`

## Requirements
- PHP version 5.6 or higher.
- cURL extension enabled (usually enabled by default).
- A writable folder on your server to store the downloaded files.

## How It Works
Once the form is submitted:
- The tool will download the file from the provided URL.
- It will save the file in the specified destination folder on your server.
- After completion, it will display success or error messages based on the outcome.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues with **file permissions**, make sure the destination folder is writable.
- For **file download failures**, check the URL to ensure it is accessible and correct. You may also encounter server-related issues that could prevent the download.
